  "description": "Write a function `draw_house(size)` that uses the `turtle` module to draw a simple house. The function should draw a square base and a triangle roof using `t.forward()`, `t.right()`, and `t.left()`. The test will only check if your code runs without errors (not the visual output). In order to pass the autograde, please include return \"drawn\" at the end of the code.",
