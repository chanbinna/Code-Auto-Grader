This folder contains problems. Each problem is a folder with a `test_cases.json` file describing test cases.

Example structure:

- sum_numbers/
  - test_cases.json

Test case format: an array of objects with keys `input` and `expected`.
`input` should be either a JSON list (to expand as args) or a single value.
